# Vitaprint heat regulator
This project is based on a arduino mega 2560 with RepRap [Ramps controller](http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4) and [Full graphic smart controller](http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller). It is still in development for the use on Symbiolab's [Vitaprint](http://irnas.eu/vitaprint) project. The code is still raw and needs fine tuning for the PID variables and thermistor reading.
